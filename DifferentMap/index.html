We can see Nothern Territory remains the top state for the number of daily smokers. People in their 40s and 50s are more likely to be smoking daily. There has been an increase in the proportion of adults who never take up smoking. There was 49% of people in 1991 that never smoked in comparison to 63% in 2019. Fun fact, the estimated social cost of tobacco use in 2015-16 was $136.7 billion.
